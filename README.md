This is a template repository for starting a new web project that is bootstrapped with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Express](https://expressjs.com).

### Quick start

If you are familiar with NodeJS development and already have it installed, simply install the dependencies and run the example!

    npm i
    npm start
    
The `start` task uses [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) to run the TypeScript source files in memory. If you want to watch for file system changes and reload the server, use the `start:watch` task.

    npm run start:watch

### Prerequisites

The only technical dependency is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). There are a few ways to install it on your machine;

- [Official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)

Node version manager allows you to install multiple versions side by side on the host machine.

### Installing from scratch

After creating a new repository from this template, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

    npm i
